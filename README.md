  # Portfolio Version 3

  ## Description

  For this revision of my portfolio, I completely changed the website. I made the website a single page, as is customary with developer portfolios. I utilized Bootstrap icons to make the links in the contact section and navbar look more professional. I removed unnecessary JavaScript that was included in the last version. Next, I selected current completed assignments that demonstrate how my skillset has improved over the course of the bootcamp. I also added a gradient to the jumbotron at the top of the page to improve the aesthetics of the site.
